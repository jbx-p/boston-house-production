# Boston Housing Dataset(EDA)

-- ObjectObjectives of this project:

1.1: To study effects of various variables on House Price

1.2: Indentification and Patten Study of Variables significantly affrcting House Price

Direct Proportionality
Inverse Proportionality
2: Price Range prediction using regression line

3: Holistic Linear Regression Machine learning Model Development to predict House Prices

4.1: Understanding housing preferences of "Custumer Segment": People of color ("Assuming" the study is done for a real estate business)

4.2: Understanding housing preferences of " customer segment"People from lower Strata of society("Assuming" the study is done for a real estate business

4.3: Brief exploratory Study of intervariable Dependencies

**Methodology:

Dataset acquired from kaggle

Dataset conververted to Pandas Dataframe

Extensive usage of Python Libraries Pandas and Numpy to manage data in DataFrames, N-Dimensional Arrays and generate visualizations

For visualization Python libraries Matplotlib, Seaborn and Plotly is used Usage of Plotly was limited More focus has been on Seaborn

Data file acquired from kaggle datasets was in pickle

Format and hence pickle was also imported

Every visualization includes Observations made by researcher

Entire project has been made in Jupyter Notebook

Project starts with a broad overview of all data points and slowly focuses on specific variables based on deliverables of Objectives in every section

Through Machine Learning algorithm has been used briefly however the project mainly focuses on Visualizations and Exploratory Data Analysis rather than focusing on model Development and Price Prediction
